# $RKET - The Trenches Game Coin
$RKET is more than just another memecoin. Itâ€™s an interactive, community-driven game where holders decide the fate of the rocket.

## The Game
- A rocket flies through space, dodging obstacles.
- The community votes on which direction the rocket should go next (left, center, right).
- Each movement powered by how much votes each direction gets. spam the one you want.
- The rocketâ€™s journey becomes a living story, shaped by the collective decisions of the community.

## Why $RKET?
- **Fun + Finance**: Blends the memecoin hype with an actual interactive game.
- **Community-Controlled**: The rocket doesnâ€™t move without its holders.
- **Gamified Holding**: Owning $RKET isnâ€™t just financial speculationâ€”itâ€™s participation in the mission.

## Built With
- ngl I built this quick with react and javascript, made it as simple as possible yet still very fun, look at the game site to see the market cap goals, and game score goals to see where we are at

## Vision
$RKET isnâ€™t just about dodging obstacles. Itâ€™s about building a community experience where every token holder plays a role in the rocketâ€™s survival. The higher the score, the more legendary the mission becomes.
